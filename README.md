## Hey, You found me! 👐🏾
### I'm Tilani - Welcome to my profile 


👩🏽‍🔬 I'm a UK-based Biomedical Scientist with a passion for data science, analytics, and problem-solving. 

🧭 I have expanded my expertise in applying statistical analysis and data visualisation to extract meaningful insights and support data driven decision making.

🌱 I'm currently building my [project portfolio](https://github.com/TilaniDW/Portfolio) to showcase the work I've done during the LSE Data Analytics Course  - and soon, my personal projects as well.
